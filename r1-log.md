## Log

### R1D1 April 24th 2018
I'm going to work on Free Code Camp modules to get better with HTML and web developement so that I can build a cool personal portfolio and learn some D3.js

### R1D2 April 25th 2018
Today I started working on the UCB The Hacker Within Tutorial to learn some D3.js.  I fumbled through the first part of the exercise to make some colored circles, but I'm struggling with the js syntax in map example.  There are so many variables I don't know, but I'm going to keep following examples to learn.  I also would like to start developing in Flask so that I can use debug mode without constantly refreshing.

### R1D3 April 26th 2018
I spent the day at work munging data for a conversion project using pandas and so I wanted to work on something totally different.  I kept working on the starter html project on free code camp.  It was all review, but it's good to get more practice.  I'm surprised that \<input\> elements are self closing.  After getting more html practice I'm going to work on using flask as a framework.

### R1D3 April 27th 2018
Today I focused on my pandas manipulation at work, I got a couple of free code camps done too.  This weekend I'm going to try to finish the html section of FCC and then migrate from just a html to flask.
