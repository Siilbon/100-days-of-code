## Log

### R1D1 
I'm going to work on Free Code Camp modules to get better with HTML and web developement so that I can build a cool personal portfolio and learn some D3.js

### R1D2
Today I started working on the UCB The Hacker Within Tutorial to learn some D3.js.  I fumbled through the first part of the exercise to make some colored circles, but I'm struggling with the js syntax in map example.  There are so many variables I don't know, but I'm going to keep following examples to learn.  I also would like to start developing in Flask so that I can use debug mode without constantly refreshing.
